#Dataflow with Props in React

Remember React is really good at managing state. Part of that is because there's a simple system for passing data from one component to another child component and that system is through props. props are to components what arguments are to functions.

Hereâ€™s a very basic example of using props.

```javascript
class HelloUser extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div> Hello, {this.props.name}</div>
    )
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<HelloUser name="Tyler"/>, document.getElementById('app'));
```

Notice when we use the component, we're passing in a name attribute. This attribute can then be accessed inside the component as this.props.name.
