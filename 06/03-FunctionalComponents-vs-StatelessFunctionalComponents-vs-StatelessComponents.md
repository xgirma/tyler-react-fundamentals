# Functional Components vs Stateless Functional Components vs Stateless Components

Earlier today I read Dan Abramov’s [“React Components, Elements, and Instances”](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/react-components-elements-and-instances-90800811f8ca) article. As always I loved the article but even more than that, this time, I loved Dan’s focus on using proper vocabulary to describe technical topics. That post gave me the idea for this post. Three ways to describe React components which are often used incorrectly — Stateless Components, Stateless Functional Components, and Functional Components.

Let’s look at the differences between the three.

### 1 Stateless Components
```javascript
const Repos = React.createClass({
  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <h3> User Repos </h3>
        <ul className="list-group">
          {this.props.repos.map((repo, index) => {
            return (
              <li className="list-group-item" key={repo.name}>
                <h4><a href={repo.html_url}>{repo.name}</a></h4>
                <p>{repo.description}</p>
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
})
class Repos extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <h3> User Repos </h3>
        <ul className="list-group">
          {this.props.repos.map((repo, index) => {
            return (
              <li className="list-group-item" key={repo.name}>
                <h4><a href={repo.html_url}>{repo.name}</a></h4>
                <p>{repo.description}</p>
              </li>
            )
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

All the code above does is it receives an array of repositories of a specific user, maps over those repositories, and displays them to the view.

You should feel pretty at home with the code above. createClass has been around since the heavens opened and bestowed React upon us and React.Component has been around since React 0.13.0 Beta 1 (January 2015). Neither component is using getInitialState or a constructor to initialize a state property. Each component is receiving its data as props then simply presenting that data.

### 2 Stateless Functional Components
```javascript
const Repos = ({repos}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h3> User Repos </h3>
      <ul className="list-group">
        {repos.map((repo, index) => {
          return (
            <li className="list-group-item" key={repo.name}>
              <h4><a href={repo.html_url}>{repo.name}</a></h4>
              <p>{repo.description}</p>
            </li>
          )
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Notice the code above is just a function (granted a fancy ES6 function but that’s besides the point). If your component has just a render method (and no state), you can simply create your component as a Stateless Functional Componentand your function will be passed props as its first argument. Also notice that we’re NOT calling this a* Stateless Component* or a Functional Component. The reason for that brings us to number 3.

### 3 Functional Components
```javascript
const ReposWithState = () => {
  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
}
```

[In the future, React will have Functional Components that contain their own state.](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/658713924607606784) This is the reason why the code in #2 above shouldn’t be called a Stateless Component nor should it be described as a Functional Component, because future Functional Components will also be able to have their own state.

I realize this might come off as hairsplitting, but I strongly believe that clearly understanding the vocabulary for technical topics will make learning and teaching said topics much easier.
